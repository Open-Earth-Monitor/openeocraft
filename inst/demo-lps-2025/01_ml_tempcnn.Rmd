# Introduction

This notebook demonstrates how to train a Temporal CNN (TempCNN) model using OpenEO processes. The example uses deforestation data from Rondonia to train a deep learning model for time series classification.

# Setup and Connection

First, we load the required libraries and connect to the OpenEO backend:

```{r}
library(openeo)
library(sits)

# Connect to the backend
con <- connect(
  host = "http://127.0.0.1:8000",
  user = "brian",
  password = "123456"
)

# Access processes
p <- processes()
```

# Load Training Data

We load the pre-processed training data for deforestation in Rondonia:

```{r}
# Load sits tibble Training data
data_deforestation_rondonia <- readRDS("./filtered_rondonia_data.rds")
```

# Define the Temporal CNN Model

Here we define the architecture and hyperparameters for our TempCNN model:

```{r}
# Define the Temporal CNN model
tempcnn_model_def <- p$mlm_class_tempcnn(
  cnn_layers = list(64, 64, 64),
  cnn_kernels = list(5, 5, 5),
  cnn_dropout_rates = list(0.2, 0.2, 0.2),
  dense_layer_nodes = 256,
  dense_layer_dropout_rate = 0.5,
  optimizer = "adam",
  learning_rate = 0.0005,
  epsilon = 0.00000001,
  weight_decay = 0.000001,
  lr_decay_epochs = 1,
  lr_decay_rate = 0.95,
  epochs = 150,
  batch_size = 64,
  seed = 42
)
```

# Model Training

Now we fit the model using our training dataset:

```{r}
# Fit the model using the training dataset
tempcnn_model_fitted <- p$ml_fit(
  model = tempcnn_model_def,
  training_set = jsonlite::serializeJSON(data_deforestation_rondonia),
  target = "label"
)
```

# Export the Trained Model

Finally, we export the trained model for future use:

```{r}
# Export the trained model
tempcnn_model <- p$export_ml_model(
  model = tempcnn_model_fitted,
  name = "tempcnn_model_20_05_25",
  folder = "openeocraft-models"
)

# Run the job
job <- create_job(
  graph = tempcnn_model,
  title = "Train Temp CNN Model",
  description = "Training a Temp CNN model and exporting it"
)
job <- start_job(job)

# Display job information
describe_job(job)
```

# Conclusion

This notebook demonstrated how to:
1. Connect to an OpenEO backend
2. Load and prepare training data
3. Define a Temporal CNN model architecture
4. Train the model
5. Export the trained model for future use

The trained model can now be used for making predictions on new time series data.
